                                       The position I want to persue is Computer engineer, a Computer engineer's job is to analyse hardware, software and other parts of a computer system using technology and provided technical tools.
                                       The other resposibilities of a computer engineer is to upgrade different hardwares like routers and motherboard as needed. This job can be a full time position or work under contract.

                                       <br>
                                       On the other hand, smaller organisations allow you to interact and create big parts of the application. The job I have found is a Java backend remote engineer,
                                       this job provides payments for various expenses and provides a work laptop of your choice.

                                       You have the option of working from the office or at your home,
                                       I believe that this is a great benefit that can be exploited in various ways including those who have families or a newborn child, can work while helping their spouse at home,
                                        and it may overall be a more comfortable environment.

                                 This job will require me to know at least one of the following languages Java, Python, Rust and C#.
                                  The employee must have at least 3 or more years of software development, and must nave experience in multiple areas and not just a master of one,
                                  this is what they mean by experience in an “agile” environment. This job also requires the programmer to be familiar with the Linux command line interface.

                        <p class="text-content">
                           I am not extremely new to Java, I have partially completed an online course regarding Java that taught me the different datatypes and the basics, I wrote multiple programs in Java and my brain is now hardwired for Java,
                           my uncle wanted me to learn swift as my first language but I was not in the financial position to purchase a device with a mac OS. I briefly learnt C# and am learning python at the moment in another unit/course.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           Another factor that should be included in my current skills is my completion of specialist mathematics, this was one of the most helpful factors in my programming education.
                           The algorithms in this unit really moulded my brain in ways I never thought were possible. It was almost like when I talk to someone, my brain creates a script based on the most logical answers and reads off it.
                           I think that this is not due to the extent of mathematics that I covered at a young age. But also due to the several hours a day I devoted to this endeavour.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           This sounds like a positive factor but in many cases I find it difficult to have an informal conversation with someone, I have to try a lot harder to come across as a normal person.
                           I finally found a way that this would come into real practicality and that was programming. As stated previously, my objective is to attend RMIT on campus education,
                           I have devoted to dedicating a significant amount of my time to my education, this is one of the ways I see myself obtaining the skills to work at this level, I would love to finish this section with a quote that a programmer once stated to me.
                           <br>
                           <br>
                           He said “you want to learn to swim? Don’t read a textbook, throw yourself in the water.” No matter how accurate this statement is, I believe that regardless of the above, without good programming experience I will never be able to work at this level.</strong> </h3>
