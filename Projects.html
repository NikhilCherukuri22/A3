                              <h2>YourSkin</h2>
                              <p class="text-content"> The Aim for my project is to create an application called “YourSkin” to help users to figure out issues and struggles that they are experiencing with their skin, and how to resolve them with a step by step routine tailored to their needs.
  <br /><br />
I came up with the idea for Yourskin when I was brainstorming issues and struggles and problems that people of my age go through. I myself am also going through some issues with my skin so I decided that this would be a good opportunity to try and help some people going through the same issues that I am. 
  <br /><br />
With a simple sample photo of your face, YourSkin will categorise your skin condition into 5 distinct categories, giving a suitable and effective skin care programme complemented by a clean yet sophisticated user interface. Once categorised, the user will be presented with a short selection of appropriate skin care regimens, with the most relevant and effective at the top. The user will then be offered the option of selecting one of the few procedures available based on their budgetary and time constraints. The many selections will vary from beginner to advanced, with the beginner requiring the least amount of time and money and the advanced requiring the most.


YourSkin will be able to take the user to the closest and cheapest pharmacy that offers the goods of the skin care regimen specified, using the Google Maps API. The user will be able to sort pharmacies ranging from best prices to highest rated and closest, based on the patient's priorities. This application will take use of alerts by reminding the user of the times when they should be finishing their routine. When this notification shows up, and the user clicks it, a checklist will popup, allowing the user to check off the goods they used in the prescribed sequence.

The user's diagnosis is determined by an algorithm that has undergone rigors machine learning and has been fed a variety of cases and categories of skin care issues. This has allowed the system to identify a diagnosis that is appropriate for the patient. Because this algorithm will be able to diagnose the majority of people, there will be situations when the difficulties are unresolvable using over-the-counter products. In this situation, the user will be sent to a local General Practitioner first, with the ultimate objective of gaining a referral to a dermatologist/skin expert.

The five categories will include hyperpigmentation/sun damage, oily/dry skin, blackheads/whiteheads, acne, and tissue scarring.

Additionally, there will be a review page with comments from users who have used the app for longer than two months. This will enable users to browse through and relate to the comments, which will increase their faith in the app and the skin care regimens it offers. The user may return to the reviews and even build their own subsequent two-month winning streak. Throughout the streak, the user will be able to send progression images that will be included in the review or simply for the user's own curiosity in order to track progress. 
So that users will have more of an incentive to continue using and logging into the app, there will be a referral system that will encourage users to refer friends and family to get more traction to the app. Once the user refers five new users who sign up In the app, they will get a sizeable discount which they can redeem on their next purchase in the app or in person at supported pharmacies.

Two key technologies and tools will be employed to ensure the application's success. First, when the user first signs in and is given the choice to sign in using social media in order to connect with friends and family, making referral much easier, this option will be provided. The Google Maps API will be utilised to lead the user to the required places. TensorFlow will also be utilised to aid our AI in categorising the various skin disorders.
                                 
  <br /><br />
In this project there are no specific roles as the one and only member of the group is me. But if I were to officially produce this application, I would hire some developers and user interface designers so that I can get some help and get the application done in an efficient manner. Personally I would be the lead developer and manager making sure everything goes in an efficient and smooth way.
  <br /><br />

What I would need for this project is the google maps AI, so that users can see where the products they were looking for are located. Additionally, TensorFlow would be required for machine learning so that it can look through various skin issues and categorise them. For this project I would require a computer with a high amount of RAM so that the AI software can efficiently run through many samples.
  <br /><br />
To test my application efficiently I would need to go through many levels of extensive testing. Firstly I would create a rough mock up of the application just to see how everything works and to figure out how to make the interface clean yet sophisticated. Next I would have created a beta version of the application, this version would be 85% complete but with a completely working interface and make sure all the essential processes of the app are running as intended. To test this I would email a beta testing advertisement to people of the targeted demographic and some outlier to accommodate for people who are not of the targeted demographic that also experience skin problems. Lastly I would do a soft launch of my application to a wider group, E.G multiple states or country wide but not globally.
  <br /><br />
The risks regarding my project include poor hiring of programmes and designers, learning how to use AI and the risk of pharmacies refusing to work with us as a distributer of the medications we provide and lastly not being able to find any general practitioners and dermatologists who are willing to team up and work with the users of my platform.
